    "# **Beyond the Surface**\n",
    "#### *Machine Learning for Predicting Well Status in Tanzania*\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Business Understanding**\n",
    "### **Background**\n",
    "In a nation where one third of the country is arid to semi-arid, access to basic water has been a constant challenge over many years. From around the 90s to early 2000s, Tanzania's water supply and sanitation was characterised by decreasing access to at least basic water sources especially in urban areas, steady access to some form of sanitation, intermittent water supply and generally low quality of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the three major lakes in the region, ground water has been the major source of water for the nation's people. In 2006, the Government of Tanzania adopted a National Water Sector Development Strategy that aimed to promote integrated water resources management and the development of urban and rural water supply. Since it's adoption, Tanzania has made significant progress improving the access of thousands of citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite efforts by the Tanzanian Government to deal with this issue, it has proved to be difficult mainly due to lack of resources. According to the [Tanzania_Economic_Update_2023](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/tanzania/publication/tanzania-economic-update-universal-access-to-water-and-sanitation-could-transform-social-and-economic-development) by World Bank Group, only 61% of households in Tanzania currently have access to a basic water-supply, a great improvement from the 2000s but also there's still room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to resources, the Tanzanian water sector remains heavily dependent on external donors with 88% of the available funds being provided by external donor organisations. However, results have been mixed. For example, a report by GIZ notes that \"despite heavy investments brought in by the World Bank and the European Union, the utility serving Dar es Salaam has remained one of the worst performing water entities in Tanzania.\" this is cited on [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Tanzania).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "The Government of Tanzania is constantly trying to increase the percentage of the water access in the country, however, this percentage is constantly being dragged downwards due to lack of well routine maintenance or follow-ups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to help the Government keep a track of the functionality status of the wells across the country, whether they are functional, need repair or non-functional to help them maintain them and build more to achieve 100% access to clean, potable water across Tanzania.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Objectives**\n",
    "This project seeks to:\n",
    "- Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a well is:\n",
    "    - *Functional*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Non-functional*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Functional but needs repair*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Achieve a target classification accuracy of **at least 85%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key features (e.g., what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, how it is managed) that drive well functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support national water development by identifying underperforming or non-functional wells using data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a blueprint system that can be adapted for similar water access initiatives globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "- *The Tanzanian Government*: By predicting which wells are functiona, non functional or need repairs, the government can have a clear idea of where resources are needed the most and help them drive their Water Development Strategy even further and improve the country's water situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *External Donors*: These are individuals or institutions who provide resources to help the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Non-Profit Organizations*: These are organizations looking to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Local Communities*: These are the people the wells help directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **In Scope**\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and relationships in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering: including interaction terms, and domain-specific transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model development using classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model validation using k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)."

    "## **Data Understanding**\n",
    "This section contains the data's initial exploration. It provides information about the source of the data, helps have a peek at the dataset to understand it's structure such as its shape, data types, etc. and also understand what kind of mess the data has, such as missing values, duplicated records, outliers, among other data integrity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Source**\n",
    "This project required a dataset that represents Tanzania's water systems updated and created by people who manage the said systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project was sourced from [DrivenData's Tanzania Water Pumps competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). Who in turn sourced it from Taarifa, an open source platform that aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Why is this dataset important to the project?*\n",
    "- A dataset sourced from the country of interest is crucial as it provides accurate and relevant information specific to the project's context, leading to more reliable results, better insights, and more effective solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows for a deeper understanding of local nuances and avoids the pitfalls of applying generalized data from other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For machine learning projects such as this, using real-world data from the target country leads to more accurate predictions and better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using inappropriate data can lead to unintended consequences and ineffective interventions.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a crucial step for any project before training a machine learning model because it ensures the data is accurate, consistent, and relevant, leading to better model performance and more reliable predictions. Cleaning data helps remove errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information that can negatively impact the model's ability to learn and generalize.\n",

    "- Dealing with categorical issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying relevant columns based on domain knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Missing Values**\n",
    "During the data understanding, we found that 7 columns contain missing values, in this section, we are exploring the columns further to make sure there is no underlying reason other than the fact that the columns are incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is crucial as missing values in datasets can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of analyses and machine learning models. Addressing ensures valid results and avoids introducing bias.\n",

    "#### *Exploring the columns*\n",
    "The first step is visually scoping the columns to understand them better. We are filtering them out and storing them in a separate variable to enable easy access as examining them in a crowd of 40 columns would prove to be difficult."
