## **Business Understanding**
### **Background**
In a nation where one third of the country is arid to semi-arid, access to basic water has been a constant challenge for the longest time. Despite the government's effort to deal with this issue, Tanzania has remained a water-stressed country.

Other than the three major lakes in the region, ground water has been the major source of water for the nation's people. It is at the back of this that in 2006, the Government of Tanzania adopted a National Water Sector Development Strategy that aimed to promote integrated water resources management and the development of urban and rural water supply.

As part of its National Water Sector Development Strategy, the Tanzanian government prioritized decentralized water supply infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on constructing wells and boreholes throughout the country. As much as it has made significant progress improving the access of thousands of citizens, it still has a long way to go.

### **Project Overview**
As of 2023, only 61% of households in Tanzania have access to a basic water-supply. The Tanzanian government has made efforts to bridge this gap, however, it has been a slow really descent. 

This project seeks to:
- Investigate why the percentage of households that have access to basic water is slightly above 50%, despite the National Water Sector Development Strategy being at work for almost 2 decades.

- Leverage machine learning to help the Government keep track of the functionality status of the wells across the country, whether functional, needs repair or non-functional.

- Provide recommendations to help the Tanzanian Government accelerate their National Water Sector Development Strategy.

### **Project Objectives**
This project seeks to:
- Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a well is:
    - *Functional*

    - *Non-functional*

    - *Functional but needs repair*

- Achieve a target classification accuracy of **at least 85%** and an F1-score of **at least 85%**.

- Identify key features (e.g., what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, how it is managed) that drive well functionality.

- Support National Water Sector Development Strategy by identifying underperforming or non-functional wells using data science tools.

- Develop a blueprint system that can be adapted for similar water access initiatives globally.

### **StakeHolders**
- *The Tanzanian Government*: By predicting which wells are functional, non functional or need repairs, the government can have a clear idea of where resources are needed the most and help them drive their Water Development Strategy even further and improve the country's water situation. 

- *External Donors*: These are individuals or institutions who provide resources to help the nation.

- *Non-Profit Organizations*: These are organizations looking to help.

- *Local Communities*: These are the people the wells help directly.

## **Data Understanding**
This project required a dataset that represents Tanzania's water systems updated and created by people who manage the said systems.

The data used in this project was sourced from [DrivenData's Tanzania Water Pumps competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). Who in turn sourced it from Taarifa, an open source platform that aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.
